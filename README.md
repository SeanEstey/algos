# MT4 Indicators and Expert Advisors

### IcedTea Robot

My attempt at building an robot that can read the market--its trend, its significant swings in relation to one another, its significant HTF levels, its impulses and retracements--and take proper trade setups through that analysis. Basically to mimic the way a trader would read/react to price action.

Swing highs and swing lows are represented onto a graph as nodes, with their relationships as edges.
